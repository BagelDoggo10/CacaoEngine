# Backend `vk-sdl` Info

## Limitations
* For some reason, the SDL header does not contain the grave/tilde key (`` ` ``/`~`), so it won't be detected as key input
* SDL does not support the F25 key (if you have that for some reason), so it won't be detected as key input

## Dependencies
* Vulkan SDK
