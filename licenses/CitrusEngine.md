## License
Ownership of all code in the Software belongs to the author of that code, be it the Developer of one of the Contributors. Any and all Derivers are obligated to disclose usage of the Software if it appears in their codebase and this disclosure must be plainly obvious to all contributors to the derived work. Any and all Users of the Software must disclose the usage of the Software in their end product to their Users. Permission is granted to redistribute the Software and to use it in a commercial environment, but the product must not be redistributed for a higher price than the original (this applies to derived works if the derived work is not dissimilar enough from the original, for example, changing the name in the code and nothing else). The Software may be modified by any contributor, but a modified version cannot be sold or distributed under the premise of being the original. Derived works are not required to use the same license as the original, though a copy of this license must be included. Any exceptions to these rules can be made by the original Developer of the code, but the derived work must include a copy of the agreement. The Developer has the express right to order a takedown of any derived work found to be violating these terms without approval of the Developer.
