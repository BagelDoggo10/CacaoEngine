List of Cacao Engine backends:

cacaoglalglfw:
	What: OpenGL (3.3 Core Profile) + GLFW + OpenAL.
	Support: Windows, Mac, and Linux
	Additional Dependencies: Refer to https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile_guide.html#compile_deps for the most up-to-date information
	on GLFW dependencies. When targeting Linux, Cacao Engine will build for both X11 and Wayland, so install both sets of dependencies. As
	an additional note, on Fedora Linux, GLFW requires the `wayland-protocols-devel` package, though this is not listed on their website.
